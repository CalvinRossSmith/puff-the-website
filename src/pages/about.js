        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> 
            My name is Calvin Smith and I am a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa.
            I have a drive for gaining a deeper understanding of how technology works. 
            It is my passion to apply this knowledge that I have gained to solve interesting real world technology problems.
            I have experience with a few amazing companies, like Espial Group and Ribbon Comminications, and also a variety of self-taught experience. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            If you want to discuss hiring me as a Co-op/Intern or part time software engineer, feel free to shoot me a message!
