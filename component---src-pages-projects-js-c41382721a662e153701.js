These tools are great tools on their own, however have trouble working as one. My goal for this project was to be able to have a fully automated home entertainment setup. The problem was that a lot of storage for automated home entertainment systems is required. With AutoPlex I was able to solve this issue by using Radarr/Sonarr to fetch the latest media. I then was able to upload new legally obtained media in an encrypted format to the cloud using a cron job running Rclone. Once in the cloud the files are renamed and sorted using Filebot. To stream the media I have configured PlexDrive to cache enough of the media on the local machine to view from Plex. All of this is configured on a headless server that has 1tb of local storage. With this solution I now have close to 30tb of encrypted media that can be reached using any plex client."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Full write up of how to do this will be posted on my Github soon!"))}},148:function(e,t,a){var o;e.exports=(o=a(149))&&o.default||o},149:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);a(34);var o=a(0),n=a.n(o),l=a(4),r=a.n(l),s=a(55),i=a(2),c=function(e){var t=e.location,a=i.default.getResourcesForPathnameSync(t.pathname);return a?n.a.createElement(s.a,Object.assign({location:t,pageResources:a},a.json)):null};c.propTypes={location:r.a.shape({pathname:r.a.string.isRequired}).isRequired},t.default=c},150:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var o=a(0),n=a.n(o),l=a(4),r=a.n(l),s=a(33),i=a.n(s);a(148),n.a.createContext({});r.a.object,r.a.string.isRequired,r.a.func,r.a.func;var c=function(e){return n.a.createElement("div",null,n.a.createElement(i.a,{to:e.to},n.a.createElement("button",{className:e.styleName},e.children)))},u=function(e){return n.a.createElement("div",null,n.a.createElement(c,{to:e.toLocal,styleName:e.styleName},e.text))},d=function(e){return n.a.createElement("div",{className:"Header"},n.a.createElement(u,{toLocal:"/",text:"Home",styleName:"HeaderButtons"}),n.a.createElement(u,{toLocal:"/about",text:"About",styleName:"HeaderButtons"}),n.a.createElement(u,{toLocal:"/resume",text:"Resume",styleName:"HeaderButtons"}),n.a.createElement(u,{toLocal:"/projects",text:"Projects",styleName:"HeaderButtons"}))};a(152),t.a=function(e){var t=e.children;return n.a.createElement("div",{className:"MainLayout"},n.a.createElement(d,{className:"Header"}),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"ChildOfChrist"},t))}}}]);
